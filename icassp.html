          <p>
            In recent years, significant advancements in emotional speech
            synthesis have emerged, driven by deep learning-based models and
            vocoders. This paper conducts experiments on vital text-to-speech
            components, namely text-to-speech models (Tacotron 2) and vocoders
            (HiFi-GAN), utilizing a custom-recorded dataset featuring emotional
            speech samples with Indian accents across five distinct emotional
            states to enhance emotional speech synthesis quality. We initially
            employ a Tacotron 2 model with WaveGlow vocoder and subsequently
            introduce the Comprehensive Tacotron Model and the HiFiGAN vocoder.
            Throughout the study, we experiment with hyperparameters, activation
            functions, loss functions, and kernel sizes to optimize HiFi-GAN's
            performance on emotional data. This work contributes to advancing
            emotional speech synthesis in Indian accents and offers valuable
            insights into the effectiveness of different vocoder configurations.
